     "description": "I have developed country's first computer-delivered mock test exactly like British Council so that you can be ready and feel comfortable in your final text. Using my online tests for IELTS preparation is proven to help students improve by 0.5 - 1.5. IELTS Mentor's unique feature allows users to “Locate” the answer within the passage and “Explain” why that answer is correct. Our community love this feature! IELTS Mentor has reached extensive cooperation with overseas institutions, international education non-profit organizations and IELTS test bureaus to provide a brand new IELTS learning platform for IELTS students around the world.",
